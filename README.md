# Intron_retetion

In this project, we study the intron splicing mediated by male gametocyte specific RNA binding protein RBPm1 in *Plasmodium yoelii*.

All the codes and files necessary for reproducing the bioinformatics analysis of this study are uploaded to this repository.

## Basic 

### Step 1
Run `RBP.Rmd` for sex-speicif RBP enrichment analysis based on *Plasmodium yoelii*, *Plasmodium berghei* and *Plasmodium falciparum* RNA-seq data.


### Step 2
Run `IR.Rmd` for intron retention analysis based on *Plasmodium yoelii* RNA-seq data.

### Data required for sex-specific RBP enrichment analysis
Located in `RBP` directory.

### Data required for intron retetion analysis
Located in `IR` directory.
